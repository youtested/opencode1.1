"""apply_patch tool: safe multi-file changes from one unified diff.

RULES (full guidance for maintainers; the sent schema is short):
- One diff may touch MANY files; every hunk verified BEFORE anything is
  written — default all-or-nothing aborts everything with all problems
  reported. partial=true applies clean files and reports only bad hunks
  (best-way: 1 bad hunk costs 1 hunk resend, not N files).
- Position-tolerant (exact context searched nearby), never fuzzy content.
  Miss reports the 3 closest real lines + read offset= anchor.
- `--- /dev/null` creates, `+++ /dev/null` deletes. dry_run previews.
- undo reverts the whole patch; history lists past patches.
- SAFETY, the same layers the edit tool uses: a file marked read-only is
  refused, a hunk that would introduce NEW syntax errors is refused, every
  write is read back and confirmed, and a failure part-way through is rolled
  back — and SAYS SO if the rollback itself failed. force=true overrides the
  refusals.
